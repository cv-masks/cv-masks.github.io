<p>A 2008 study on masks: <a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/">Professional & 
	Home-Made Face Masks Reduce Exposure to Respiratory Infections among 
	the General Population</a> </p>

<p style="font-size: 80%">From that study, an excerpt from the results section: [...] Surgical masks provided about twice as much protection as home made 
		masks, the difference a bit more marked among adults. FFP2 masks provided adults 
		with about 50 times as much protection as home made masks, and 25 times as much 
		protection as surgical masks. [...]</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%">From that study, an excerpt from the results section: [...] When analysing only households 
	where intervention was implemented within 36 hours

	significantly lower compared to the group [that wore no masks in the house] [...]</p>
