<p style="font-size: 80%">Context: Some countries have said facemasks don't work for Coronavirus self-protection (unless you're a medical professional). 
	Some countries have passed laws or rules that all everyone in public should have a facemask (and gloves?) on, including 
	rationing new masks. This page is about scientific studies not conflicting national policies - March 2020</p>
	
<p><strong>Six studies on use of face masks use to avoid viruses (Not COVID-19 specifically). These would be in 
	addition to other practices, NOT instead of.</strong></p>
	
<p>1) A 2008 study on masks: <a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/">Professional & 
	Home-Made Face Masks Reduce Exposure to Respiratory Infections among 
	the General Population</a> (Listed on the USA's "National Center for Biotechnology 
	Information" site) </p>

<p style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 80%">From that study, an excerpt from the &quot;results&quot; section: [...] Surgical masks provided about twice as much protection as home made 
		masks, the difference a bit more marked among adults. FFP2 masks provided adults 
		with about 50 times as much protection as home made masks, and 25 times as much 
		protection as surgical masks. [...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 80%">From that study, an excerpt from the &quot;results&quot; section: [...] When analysing only households

<p style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 80%">From that study, an excerpt from the &quot;conclusion&quot; section: [...] Common fabric materials and cloth masks showed a [widely varied in effectiveness]
	[The material used in N95 / FFP1 masks are far superior] but [the materials tested were] in the range found 
	for some surgical masks in previous studies. [higher velocity particles and badly fitting masks could make 
	homemade masks mostly ineffective]</p>

<p style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 80%">From that study, an excerpt from the &quot;Main Findings&quot; section: [...] our

<p>Footnote: The size of influenza virus - 80–120 nanometers in diameter (refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus">Wikipedia</a>) 
	and the size of Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is debated (bigger would be better for homemade masks):</p>
