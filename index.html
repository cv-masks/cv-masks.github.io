<p style="font-size: 80%">Context: Some countries have said facemasks don't work for Coronavirus self-protection (unless you're a medical professional). 
	Some countries have passed laws or rules that all everyone in public should have a facemask (and gloves?) on, including 
	rationing new masks. This page is about scientific studies not conflicting national policies - March 2020</p>
	
<p>Studies pertinent to face masks use to avoid viruses. Not COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 specifically even though the diameter is comparable . Two listed on a "National Center for Biotechnology 
	Information" (NCBI, USA) site, and one listed on an "Oxford Academic" site (UK)</p>

	Home-Made Face Masks Reduce Exposure to Respiratory Infections among 
	the General Population</a> </p>

<p style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 80%">From that study, an excerpt from the &quot;results&quot; section: [...] Surgical masks provided about twice as much protection as home made 
		masks, the difference a bit more marked among adults. FFP2 masks provided adults 
		with about 50 times as much protection as home made masks, and 25 times as much 
		protection as surgical masks. [...]</p>
