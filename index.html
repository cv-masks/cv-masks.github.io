<p>Studies pertinent to face masks use to avoid virus (not COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 specifically). Two listed on a "National Center for Biotechnology 
	Information" (NCBI, USA) site, and one listed on an "Oxford Academic" site (UK)</p>
	
<p>A 2008 study on masks: <a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/">Professional & 
	Home-Made Face Masks Reduce Exposure to Respiratory Infections among 
	the General Population</a> </p>

<p style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 80%">From that study, an excerpt from the &quot;results&quot; section: [...] Surgical masks provided about twice as much protection as home made 
		masks, the difference a bit more marked among adults. FFP2 masks provided adults 
		with about 50 times as much protection as home made masks, and 25 times as much 
		protection as surgical masks. [...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 80%">If you are wearing a homemade mask, then no medical professional or emergency service 
	        worker is being deprived of a mask, Articles on homemade masks being made in Hong Kong and other places 
	are too numerous to detail here, but here's a list:

	</p>
	
<p>A 2011 study on masks: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3285078/">Facemasks 
	and hand hygiene in the prevention of Influenza transmission 
	at home</a> (randomised trial)</p>
	
<p style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 80%">From that study, an excerpt from the &quot;results&quot; section: [...] When analysing only households 
	where intervention was implemented within 36 hours 
	after symptom onset of the [first family member infected], secondary infection in the [groups wearing masks in the house] was 
	significantly lower compared to the group [that wore no masks in the house] [...]</p>
	
<p>A 2010 study on masks: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/54/7/789/202744">Simple Respiratory 
	Protection—Evaluation of the Filtration Performance of Cloth Masks and Common Fabric Materials Against 
	20–1000 nm Size Particles</a></p>	
	
<p style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 80%">From that study, an excerpt from the &quot;conclusion&quot; section: [...] Common fabric materials and cloth masks showed a [widely varied in effectiveness]
	[The material used in N95 / FFP1 masks are far superior] but [the materials tested were] in the range found 
	for some surgical masks in previous studies. [higher velocity particles and badly fitting masks could make 
	homemade masks mostly ineffective]</p>
